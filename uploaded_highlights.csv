"But the strength of belief would hinder us from attaining knowledge. Belief certainly may be something strong, but it is empty, and too little of the whole man can be involved, if our life with God is grounded only on belief. Should we simply believe first and foremost? That seems too cheap to me. Men who have understanding should not just believe, but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their ability. Belief is not everything, but neither is knowledge. Belief does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing. Desiring knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief. Both must strike a balance. But it is also dangerous to believe too much, because today everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a beyond full of strange and mighty things. He could easily take everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing but a lunatic. The childishness of belief breaks down in the face of our present necessities. We need differentiating knowledge to clear up the confusion which the discovery of the soul has brought in.

"you teach that man is a gateway? A gateway through which the procession of the Gods passes? Through which the stream of life flows? Through which the entire future streams into the endlessness of the past?” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered, saying, “These dead believed in the transformation and development of man. They were convinced of human nothingness and transitoriness. Nothing was clearer to them than this, and yet they knew that man even creates its Gods, and so they knew that the Gods were of no use. Therefore they had to learn what they did not know, that man is a gateway through which crowds the train of the Gods and the coming and passing of all times. He does not do it, does not create it, does not suffer it, since he is the being, the sole being, since he is the moment of the world, the eternal moment.

It has been described as: “A special teaching without scriptures, beyond words and letters, pointing to the mind-essence of man, seeing directly into one’s nature, attaining enlightenment.” Zen was known as Ch’an in China. The Ch’an-Zen masters, instead of being followers of the Buddha, aspire to be his friends and to place themselves in the same responsive relationship with the universe as did Buddha and Jesus.

It would be better if you died. That would solve the problem.” The next time Mamiya appeared before his teacher he was again asked what he had to show regarding the sound of one hand. Mamiya at once fell over as if he were dead. “You are dead all right,” observed the teacher. “But how about that sound?” “I haven’t solved that yet,” replied Mamiya, looking up. “Dead men do not speak,” said the teacher. “Get","Zen Flesh, Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings","Paul Reps, Nyogen Senzaki","uploaded,uploaded",692.0

It was rooted in China by Bodhidharma, who came from India in the sixth century, and was carried eastward into Japan by the twelfth century. It has been described as: “A special teaching without scriptures, beyond words and letters, pointing to the mind-essence of man, seeing directly into one’s nature, attaining enlightenment.” Zen was known as Ch’an in China. The Ch’an-Zen masters, instead of being followers of the Buddha, aspire to be his friends and to place themselves in the same responsive relationship with the universe as did Buddha and Jesus.

Through which the entire future streams into the endlessness of the past?” ΦΙΛΗΜΩΝ answered, saying, “These dead believed in the transformation and development of man. They were convinced of human nothingness and transitoriness. Nothing was clearer to them than this, and yet they knew that man even creates its Gods, and so they knew that the Gods were of no use. Therefore they had to learn what they did not know, that man is a gateway through which crowds the train of the Gods and the coming and passing of all times. He does not do it, does not create it, does not suffer it, since he is the being, the sole being, since he is the moment of the world, the eternal moment.

"But the strength of belief would hinder us from attaining knowledge. Belief certainly may be something strong, but it is empty, and too little of the whole man can be involved, if our life with God is grounded only on belief. Should we simply believe first and foremost? That seems too cheap to me. Men who have understanding should not just believe, but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their ability. Belief is not everything, but neither is knowledge. Belief does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing. Desiring knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief. Both must strike a balance. But it is also dangerous to believe too much, because today everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a beyond full of strange and mighty things. He could easily take everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing but a lunatic. The childishness of belief breaks down in the face of our present necessities. We need differentiating knowledge to clear up the confusion which the discovery of the soul has brought in.

"Jung is guilty of recognizing only one side of Nietzsche, at the expense of seeing Nietzsche as he had asked to be seen – ‘as a whole’. Nietzsche and Jung present the same criteria for the diagnosis of mental health/illness – the equilibration and unification of opposites/the promotion of one opposite at the expense of the other. I have argued that Jung’s diagnosis of Nietzsche’s ‘pathological personality’ is not only incorrect (Nietzsche does not promote one opposite at the expense of the other) but also really a self-diagnosis. Jung is mentally imbalanced himself, and this materializes in his one-sided interpretation of Nietzsche. In accordance with their common model for the diagnosis of mental illness, Nietzsche is not a mentally ill personality per se, but Jung is. Jung is mentally ill according to his own insights. Thus far I have concluded that, according to Jung’s model, Nietzsche has more potential for attaining Selfhood in the union of opposites than Jung gives him credit for, while the potential for Jung himself is less, for he must still recognize and reclaim his shadow projections (that have been projected on to Nietzsche). I have yet to offer a diagnosis of the two men according to Nietzsche’s model.

"‘plunging into the multiplicity of the objective world’ (Jung, 1913, par. 876), and the Apollinian is equated with introversion because Apollo is a withdrawal of the libido into oneself or ‘shut up within oneself’ (ibid.). However, in 1921, in Psychological Types (CW, 6), Jung uses Nietzsche’s distinction between the Dionysian and Apollinian to develop his model further. Jung devotes a whole, albeit brief, chapter to ‘The Apollinian and the Dionysian’ (pars. 223–242), and throughout he refers to passages in The Birth of Tragedy where Nietzsche specifically alludes to the relationship between Dionysus and Apollo. Jung’s revision of both his ‘typological’ theory and his interpretation of Nietzsche’s opposing impulses is announced when Jung claims that it is now necessary to go beyond the distinction between introversion and extraversion.

"Let's look at what happens if we stack N convolutional layers. For simplicity let's look at one dimensional inputs, which are white circles. Our first one by three convolutional layer will have a reception field of 1 by 3. When we take a second convolutional layer with the same size, then we have a receptive field of 1 by 5. If it continued after the fourth level, then we have a receptive field of 1 by 9. Can you derive a formula from this? Of course, if we stack N convolutional layers with the same kernel size 3 by 3, the receptive field on N layer will be 2N + 1 by 2N +1. What does it mean? It looks like we need to stack a lot of convolutional layers to be able to identify objects as big as input image, let's say 300 by 300, we will need 150 convolutional layers. We need to grow receptive field faster. We can increase a stride in our convolutional layer to reduce the output dimensions. Let's see how it works for 2 by 2 convolution with stride 2.

But here, we try to smooth that indicator so that our problem becomes differentiable. This is exactly why it is called activation function. Because, it allows our artificial neuron to activate when a certain sum is computed. So, you can think of an artificial neuron as something that is correlation activated. So, when it sees an input that is similar to the pattern that it tries to find in a data, then it has a huge activation in output.

And the second one is the fact that this activation function is zero for a negative axis. Which means that if you're unlucky during initialization of your neuron, you can have such waits that will give you zero activation. And if you're unlucky enough then this neuron will never update because for that part where x is less than zero, you have zero gradient. So it is called the problem of dying ReLu neuron.

Because, it allows our artificial neuron to activate when a certain sum is computed. So, you can think of an artificial neuron as something that is correlation activated. So, when it sees an input that is similar to the pattern that it tries to find in a data, then it has a huge activation in output. You need to notice one thing though, we need that non-linear activation functions. So, we can't make that neuron simpler than we have already discussed.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes | Coursera,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",4.0
". So, the main problems that are still there in training of our MLP is the following. First, we can have many hidden layers, right? It's a hyperparameter it constitutes our architecture, and that means that we need to calculate our gradients automatically, no matter what architecture we have. So, we need to code that algorithm that can do that for any number of hidden layers, that is the first problem. The second problem is that we can have many neurons. In fact, in modern architectures, you can have a billion of them, and we need to calculate gradients fast, because if you have a billion neurons, then you have to do that fast",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes | Coursera,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",2.0

If the other person defects, then it's the best response to defect but in fact, it's much stronger than that, it's best to defect no matter what the other the other agent does.

"Much of the original gains of the GoogLeNet network [20] arise from a very generous use of dimension reduction. This can be viewed as a special case of factorizing  convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. Consider for example the case of a 1 × 1 convolutional layer  followed by a 3 × 3 convolutional layer. In a vision network, it is expected that the outputs of near-by activations  are highly correlated. Therefore, we can expect that their  activations can be reduced before aggregation and that this  should result in similarly expressive local representations.  Here we explore other ways of factorizing convolutions",1512.00567.pdf,arxiv.org,"uploaded,uploaded",4.0
"Still, grave deviations from these principles tended to result in deterioration  in the quality of the networks and fixing situations where  those deviations were detected resulted in improved architectures in general.  1. Avoid representational bottlenecks, especially early in  the network. Feed-forward networks can be represented by an acyclic graph from the input layer(s) to  the classifier or regressor. This defines a clear direction  for the information flow. For any cut separating the inputs from the outputs, one can access the amount of  information passing though the cut. One should avoid  bottlenecks with extreme compression. In general the  representation size should gently decrease from the inputs to the outputs before reaching the final representation used for the task at hand. Theoretically, information content can not be assessed merely by the dimensionality of the representation as it discards important factors like correlation structure; the dimensionality merely provides a rough estimate of information  content.  2. Higher dimensional representations are easier to process locally within a network. Increasing the activations per tile in a convolutional network allows for  more disentangled features. The resulting networks  will train faster.  3. Spatial aggregation can be done over lower dimensional embeddings without much or any loss in representational power. For example, before performing a  more spread out (e.g. 3 × 3) convolution, one can reduce the dimension of the input representation before  the spatial aggregation without expecting serious adverse effects. We hypothesize that the reason for that  is the strong correlation between adjacent unit results  in much less loss of information during dimension reduction, if the outputs are used in a spatial aggregation context. Given that these signals should be easily  compressible, the dimension reduction even promotes  faster learning.  4. Balance the width and depth of the network. Optimal  performance of the network can be reached by balancing the number of filters per stage and the depth of  the network. Increasing both the width and the depth  of the network can contribute to higher quality networks. However, the optimal improvement for a constant amount of computation can be reached if both are  increased in parallel. The computational budget should  therefore be distributed in a balanced way between the  depth and width of the network.",1512.00567.pdf,arxiv.org,"uploaded,uploaded",3.0

"In English, the words \xe2\x80\x9cexplore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexploit\xe2\x80\x9d come loaded with completely opposite connotations. But to a computer scientist, these words have much more specific and neutral meanings. Simply put, exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result. It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly intuitive that never exploring is no way to live. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that never exploiting can be every bit as bad. In the computer science definition, exploitation actually comes to characterize many of what we consider to be life\xe2\x80\x99s best moments. A family gathering together on the holidays is exploitation. So is a bookworm settling into a reading chair with a hot cup of coffee and a beloved favorite, or a band playing their greatest hits to a crowd of adoring fans, or a couple that has stood the test of time dancing to \xe2\x80\x9ctheir song.\xe2\x80\x9d What\xe2\x80\x99s more, exploration can be a curse.

Or, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a music journalist, part of what\xe2\x80\x99s terrible about music is that there are constantly new things to listen to. Being a music journalist means turning the exploration dial all the way to 11, where it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but new things all the time. Music lovers might imagine working in music journalism to be paradise, but when you constantly have to explore the new you can never enjoy the fruits of your connoisseurship\xe2\x80\x94a particular kind of hell.

"Expectations and preconceived notions can have a measurable impact on performance. In 1999, Canadian psychologist, Steven Spencer, conducted an experiment in which he gave two groups of students the same test of logical reasoning. The only difference between the tests was that one group was told the goal of the test was to assess the gap between the ways males and females think logically while the other group did not receive any priming. The girls in the group that was told there was a gap between the logic of boys and girls performed worse on the task than the girls in the group that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t led to believe there was a logic gap between genders.

"Many of us have an aversion to details. An inability to scan and switch channels plays into this aversion. To scan for details, we have to attend to numerous pieces of data. We find that our brains are uncooperative when we try to absorb many details simultaneously. We may forget much of what we see or hear. When we try to remember sequential details, we can lose the first step before we can assimilate the second. Our preference for the gestalt (the big picture) over miscellaneous details may in part result from this difficulty with data processing.

The process of scanning the contents of a large department store can be agonizing.

He alone occupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its object, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting union with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss for which she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes: embraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires, overmaster her soul.

According to Nietzsche, it is individuals\xe2\x80\x99 sense-experience that leads them to believe that things in life are regular and stable; their language then goes beyond this experience and strengthens the impression of regularity and stability by abstracting from individual",Nietzsche and Jung: The Whole Self in the Union of Opposites,Lucy Huskinson,"downloaded,uploaded,uploaded",589.0

And also, if we use stochastic versions of gradient descent, that approximate gradients, then this method is much more effective both in terms of computations and memory.

Then we calculate the gradient for every of these examples. And than we average their gradients, and make a step towards this direction. So in mini-batch gradient descent, we use m points to estimate the full gradient instead of one point like a stochastic gradient descent. The updates of mini-batch gradient descent have much less noise than stochastic gradient descent. And this might still can be used in online learning setting. Just accumulate n examples from your stream, and then you make an update. And still, learning rate eta t should be chosen very carefully for mini-batch gradient descent.

So, vector ht would be large for component where gradients have the same sign on every iteration, and will make large steps by this coordinates.

"He went the way of self-denial by means of pain, through voluntarily suffering and overcoming pain, hunger, thirst, tiredness. He went the way of self-denial by means of meditation, through imagining the mind to be void of all conceptions. These and other ways he learned to go, a thousand times he left his self, for hours and days he remained in the non-self. But though the ways led away from the self, their end nevertheless always led back to the self. Though Siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed in nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was inevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he found himself back in the sunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once again his self and Siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which had been forced upon him.

Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal.

And while Siddhartha stopped thinking of himself and his wound, this realisation of Vasudeva's changed character took possession of him, and the more he felt it and entered into it, the less wondrous it became, the more he realised that everything was in order and natural, that Vasudeva had already been like this for a long time, almost forever, that only he had not quite recognised it, yes, that he himself had almost reached the same state.

"From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: “You would not have given more than a penny.” “That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A ducat is much less to me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: “Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice…",THE PRINCE (Wisehouse Classics Edition),Nicolo Machiavelli,"uploaded,uploaded",2025.0

Scientists give it a more clinical description: a state of “restful alertness.” It is there. Deep within. Right now and at all times. Believe it or not. The problem is, we have lost access to it. The purpose of TM is to open the door to this unbounded field. There is no concentration or control of the mind; nothing guided; no suggestion or passive observation.

"From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not have given more than a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \xe2\x80\x9cA ducat is much less to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cFisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\xe2\x80\x9d; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\xe2\x80\x9d Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cThou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\xe2\x80\x9d A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \xe2\x80\x9cFool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\xe2\x80\x9d Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d and was answered: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice\xe2\x80\xa6",THE PRINCE (Wisehouse Classics Edition),Nicolo Machiavelli,"downloaded,uploaded,uploaded",2025.0

But what if I hadn\t been willing? You were willing. Look, Kamala: When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn\t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has",Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"downloaded,uploaded,uploaded",632.0

Belief certainly may be something strong, but it is empty, and too little of the whole man can be involved, if our life with God is grounded only on belief. Should we simply believe first and foremost? That seems too cheap to me. Men who have understanding should not just believe, but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their ability. Belief is not everything, but neither is knowledge. Belief does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing. Desiring knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief. Both must strike a balance. But it is also dangerous to believe too much, because today everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a beyond full of strange and mighty things. He could easily take everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing but a lunatic. The childishness of belief breaks down in the face of our present necessities.

So, we have an indicator function that says that, okay, if a value is positive, then output one, otherwise output zero. This is indicator. But here, we try to smooth that indicator so that our problem becomes differentiable. This is exactly why it is called activation function. Because, it allows our artificial neuron to activate when a certain sum is computed. So, you can think of an artificial neuron as something that is correlation activated. So, when it sees an input that is similar to the pattern that it tries to find in a data, then it has a huge activation in output.

So, we need to code that algorithm that can do that for any number of hidden layers, that is the first problem. The second problem is that we can have many neurons.

"So what is the point of this method? Suppose that we have some function, it'll make gradient descent, and maybe for some coordinates of our parameter vector. Gradients always have the same sign, so they lead us to the minimum. And for some coordinates, the sign of the gradient changes from iteration to iteration. So, vector ht would be large for component where gradients have the same sign on every iteration, and will make large steps by this coordinates. And for coordinates that change sign, they will just cancel each other and ht will be close to zero. So, ht cancels some coordinates that lead to oscillation of gradients, and help us to achieve better convergence.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",14.0
", we calculate the gradient at current point w t-1. We take a gradient step from it by gt, and we then get our momentum, ht. But since it's certain that we'll move in the direction of the momentum, it will be more clever to, first, step in the direction of ht to get some new approximation of parameter vector.

So in this case, we'll get a better approximation on the next step.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",13.0
"n AdaGrad, we've obtained additional value for each parameter from all our parameter vector, G. So to calculate it, we take G t-1, G from the previous iteration. We take j-th component of it, and we just add a square of gradient at the current iteration. So essentially, G is a sum of squares of gradients from all previous iterations, and then we modify our gradient step. We divide our learning rate, eta t, by the square root of G t j, plus some small number, epsilon. We add epsilon, just to make sure that we don't divide learning rate by zero. So this AdaGrad method, it chooses learning rate adaptively. Here, we can just set eta t, our learning rate, to some constant, for example, 0.01, and don't remember about it at all. So this doesn't need to somehow wisely choose learning rate, but it also has some disadvantages.

"By the way, AdaGrad has another advantage, it chooses its own learning rate for each example. So suppose that we are analyzing texts, and each feature from our sample corresponds to one word. So for some frequent word that we see in every document, we have gradient updates on every step, and we'll make smaller steps. And for some rare words that we can met only in one of thousand or ten thousand documents, we'll make large updates, because they are rare, we don't need them very often. And we need to move faster in the direction of these words.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",10.0

One of such methods is AdaGrad.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",12.0
"Another matter that can improve AdaGrad is RMSprop. This method is very similar to AdaGrad, but here we take an exponentially weighted average of squares of gradients on every step",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",9.0
"For example, we could reduce a dimensionality of our data. For example, remove some redundant features or maybe apply principal component analysis to get some new good features or we can augment our data. For example, if we work with images, we can distort them, flip, rotate, or something else. So we have more data and it's harder for our model to overfit on it. We can use dropout that we'll discuss in full in the weeks of our course. We can somehow use early stopping. So if we use gradient descent, we can stop, for example, at hundredth iteration, so our model doesn't have a way to overfit, it stops early and it underfits to our data. And of course, we can just collect more data. The more data we have, the harder it's for our model to overfit.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",5.0
"To overcome some of these problems, one can use mini-batch gradient descent, which merges some properties of the gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. So in mini-batch gradient descent, on every iteration we choose m random examples from our training sample. You know their indices by i1, etc, im. Then we calculate the gradient for every of these examples. And than we average their gradients, and make a step towards this direction. So in mini-batch gradient descent, we use m points to estimate the full gradient instead of one point like a stochastic gradient descent. The updates of mini-batch gradient descent have much less noise than stochastic gradient descent. And this might still can be used in online learning setting. Just accumulate n examples from your stream, and then you make an update. And still, learning rate eta t should be chosen very carefully for mini-batch gradient descent. And also there is another problem with this stochastic and nonstochastic methods. Suppose that we have a difficult function that has levelized like this. They have elliptic form.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",7.0
"adient descent when you receive another example from the click stream, you can just make one gradient step for this particular example, and that would be online learning. There is also a disadvantage of stochastic gradient descent. Learning rate nt should be chosen very carefully because if you choose a large learning rate, then the matrix cannot converge. And if you choose too small learning rate, then the conversions will be too small to require thousands and maybe millions of iterations to converge to the minimum",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",6.0
"As you remember, there is an analytical solution for min squared error and linear regression, but is inferior to gradient descent because first of all, gradient descent is easier to implement. You don't need to solve some systems of linear equations to calculate the minimum of our function. Gradient descent is a very general framework that allows us to minimize any differentiable loss function, not only min squared error but cross-entropy and all other losses. And also, if we use stochastic versions of gradient descent, that approximate gradients, then this method is much more effective both in terms of computations and memory. In this video, we discussed gradient descent, a method that can optimize any differentiable function, and discussed that it has many questions, like how to choose learning rate, or how to initialize w, or some other questions. And we'll discuss them in following videos and in following weeks of our course.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",4.0
"we'll need some notation -- Iverson brackets. They denote just basic square brackets, and we write some logical statement inside the brackets. If the statement is true, then the value of brackets is one, and if the statement is false, then the value of brackets is zero. So, now let's define accuracy metric. Let's take an example xi, find the prediction a of xi, and compare it to the true value of class yi and write the equality of predicted class and true class in Iverson brackets. So, the value of the bracket will be one if we guessed the class correctly, and then it will be zero if we are misclassifying these points",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",3.0
"So we cannot optimize it -- we cannot learn the model to accuracy score. And also, this model doesn't take into account the confidence of our model in this prediction. So actually, we have a dot product of weight vector and feature vector w and x, and the larger the score, the more the model is confident in this prediction. If this dot product has a positive sign and a large value, then the model is confident. But if the sign is positive, but the value is close to zero, then the model is inconfident. And we want not only a model that makes correct decisions -- that gets its classes -- but we want a confident model, and it's known from machine learning that models with high confidence generalize better.",Introduction to Deep Learning - Notes,coursera.org,"uploaded,uploaded",2.0

So, after this step, we have a vector e to the degree of z that has only positive coordinates. So now we need only to normalize these components to get a distribution. And to do it, we just sum all the components of this e-to-z vector and divide each component by the sum. And after that, we get a vector sigma of z that is normalized and has only non-negative components. So we can interpret it as a probability distribution.

"In English, the words “explore” and “exploit” come loaded with completely opposite connotations. But to a computer scientist, these words have much more specific and neutral meanings. Simply put, exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result. It’s fairly intuitive that never exploring is no way to live. But it’s also worth mentioning that never exploiting can be every bit as bad. In the computer science definition, exploitation actually comes to characterize many of what we consider to be life’s best moments. A family gathering together on the holidays is exploitation. So is a bookworm settling into a reading chair with a hot cup of coffee and a beloved favorite, or a band playing their greatest hits to a crowd of adoring fans, or a couple that has stood the test of time dancing to “their song.” What’s more, exploration can be a curse. Part of what’s nice about music, for instance, is that there are constantly new things to listen to. Or, if you’re a music journalist, part of what’s terrible about music is that there are constantly new things to listen to. Being a music journalist means turning the exploration dial all the way to 11, where it’s nothing but new things all the time. Music lovers might imagine working in music journalism to be paradise, but when you constantly have to explore the new you can never enjoy the fruits of your connoisseurship—a particular kind of hell. Few people know this experience as deeply as Scott Plagenhoef, the former editor in chief of Pitchfork. “You try to find spaces when you’re working to listen to something that you just want to listen to,” he says of a critic’s life. His desperate urges to stop wading through unheard tunes of dubious quality and just listen to what he loved were so strong that Plagenhoef would put only new music on his iPod, to make himself physically incapable of abandoning his duties in those moments when he just really, really, really wanted to listen to the Smiths.",Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions,"Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths","uploaded,uploaded",551.0

We are like unto the Mayfly floating on the waters, gazing upon the Sun, and then we are no more. All is transitory. The sleeping and the dead, how alike they are. They both portray the image of Mortality. No distinction is there between master and servant when both have reached the end of their allotted life span and breathed their last. The Anunnaki, the Assembly of Great Gods, together with Mammetum, Maker of Destiny, do ordain the Fate of men. Both Death and Life do they allot, but the hour of his Death is not for a man to know.”       Tablet XI     Gilgamesh said unto Utanapishtim, The Distant One, “I gaze upon you, old man, and now do I know you.",Gilgamesh: The New Translation,Gerald J.

"Nerds are used to transparency. They add value by becoming expert at a technical skill like computer programming. In engineering disciplines, a solution either works or it fails. You can evaluate someone else’s work with relative ease, as surface appearances don’t matter much. Sales is the opposite: an orchestrated campaign to change surface appearances without changing the underlying reality. This strikes engineers as trivial if not fundamentally dishonest. They know their own jobs are hard, so when they look at salespeople laughing on the phone with a customer or going to two-hour lunches, they suspect that no real work is being done. If anything, people overestimate the relative difficulty of science and engineering, because the challenges of those fields are obvious.

"The great health — Being new, nameless, hard to understand, we premature births of an as yet unproven future need for a new goal also a new means—namely, a new health, stronger, more seasoned, tougher, more audacious, and gayer than any previous health. Whoever has a soul that craves to have experienced the whole range of values and desiderata to date, and to have sailed around all the coasts of this ideal “mediterranean”; whoever wants to know from the adventures of his own most authentic experience how a discoverer and conqueror of the ideal feels, and also an artist, a saint, a legislator, a sage, a scholar, a pious man, a soothsayer,156 and one who stands divinely apart in the old style—needs one thing above everything else: the great health—that one does not merely have but also acquires continually, and must acquire because one gives it up again and again, and must give it up. And now, after we have long been on our way in this manner, we argonauts of the ideal, with more daring perhaps than is prudent, and have suffered shipwreck and damage often enough, but are, to repeat it, healthier than one likes to permit us, dangerously healthy, ever again healthy—it will seem to us as if, as a reward, we now confronted an as yet undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet, something beyond all the lands and nooks of the ideal so far, a world so overrich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it has got beside itself—alas, now nothing will sate us any more! After such vistas and with such a burning hunger in our conscience and science,157 how could we still be satisfied with present-day man? It may be too bad but it is inevitable that we find it difficult to remain serious when we look at his worthiest goals and hopes, and perhaps we do not even bother to look any more. Another ideal runs ahead of us, a strange, tempting, dangerous ideal to which we should not wish to persuade anybody because we do not readily concede the right to it to anyone: the ideal of a spirit who plays naively—that is, not deliberately but from overflowing power and abundance—with all that was hitherto called holy, good, untouchable, divine; for whom those supreme things that the people naturally accept as their value standards, signify danger, decay, debasement, or at least recreation, blindness, and temporary self-oblivion; the ideal of a human, superhuman well-being and benevolence158 that will often appear inhuman—for example, when it confronts all earthly seriousness so far, all solemnity in gesture, word, tone, eye, morality, and task so far, as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody—and in spite of all of this, it is perhaps only with him that great seriousness really begins, that the real question mark is posed for the first time, that the destiny of the soul changes, the hand moves forward, the tragedy begins.",The Gay Science: With a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs,Friedrich Nietzsche and Walter Kaufmann,"uploaded,uploaded",5708.0

The goddess felt compassion for the cat and transformed her into a fair damsel. As a result, the young man fell in love with the beautiful young woman and eventually took her home as his bride. When they were sitting in their room, Venus wanted to know whether she had changed the cat’s nature by changing her shape, and so she set a mouse down before her. Forgetting her human condition, the damsel jumped from her seat and pounced on the mouse as if she would have eaten it on the spot.

"She was a good creature, who had grown up in the narrow sphere of household industry and weekly-appointed labour; one who knew no pleasure beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays, arrayed in her best attire, accompanied by her friends, or perhaps joining in the dance now and then at some festival, and chatting away her spare hours with a neighbour, discussing the scandal or the quarrels of the village,—trifles sufficient to occupy her heart. At length the warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown wishes. Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasures become by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him she now rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; she sees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only. He alone occupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its object, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting union with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss for which she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes: embraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires, overmaster her soul. She floats in a dim, delusive anticipation of her happiness; and her feelings become excited to their utmost tension. She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the object of all her wishes—and her lover forsakes her. Stunned and bewildered, she stands upon a precipice. All is darkness around her. No prospect, no hope, no consolation—forsaken by him in whom her existence was centred! She sees nothing of the wide world before her, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply the void in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by the world; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her soul, she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broad embrace of death. See here, Albert, the history of thousands; and tell me, is not this a case of physical infirmity? Nature has no way to escape from the labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: she can contend no longer, and the poor soul must die. “Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, ‘The foolish girl! she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wear off the impression; her despair would have been softened, and she would have found another lover to comfort her.’ One might as well say, ‘The fool, to die of a fever! why did he not wait till his strength was restored, till his blood became calm? all would then have gone well, and he would have been alive now.’”",The Sorrows of Young Werther (Dover Thrift Editions),Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"uploaded,uploaded",668.0

"Much may be alleged in favour of rules, as much may be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society: an artist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad or disgusting; as a man who observes the laws, and obeys decorum, can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor a decided villain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy the genuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression. Do not tell me “that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prune superfluous branches, etc.” My good friend, I will illustrate this by an analogy. These things resemble love. A warmhearted youth becomes strongly attached to a maiden: he spends every hour of the day in her company, wears out his health, and lavishes his fortune, to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted to her. Then comes a man of the world, a man of place and respectability, and addresses him thus: “My good young friend, love is natural; but you must love within bounds. Divide your time: devote a portion to business, and give the hours of recreation to your mistress. Calculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you may make her a present, only not too often,—on her birthday, and such occasions.” Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful member of society, and I should advise every prince to give him an appointment; but it is all up with his love, and with his genius if he be an artist. O my friend! why is it that the torrent of genius so seldom bursts forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowing stream, overwhelming your astounded soul?

During a telephone call, the ADDer may snap at a spouse who makes the slightest noise in the room. Unfiltered visual distractions can make shopping a nightmare.

It might seem paradoxical that a workaholic could have attentional problems. It might seem paradoxical that a high-energy adult could have trouble getting started on his work.

When all the dimensions of attention are considered, it becomes easier to understand the diversity of the manifestations of ADD.

Metamorphosis can be a liberation in this poem, or a claustrophobic nightmare; it can be banal, or sublime, a realization of a person’s possibilities or ‘a savage reduction’,6 sometimes an apparent appendage with no evident link or motive. The main connecting thread is an interest in identity: what is it about a person that makes them that person, and what is it about humans that makes them human? As one human character after another transgresses into different categories of the animate and inanimate, the poet charts the bizarre mixture of convention and nature that cumulatively works to establish what we take to be normal for humans. Books 9 and 10 take this interest to the limit, as Ovid and then Orpheus give us successive stories of aberrant sexual desire, with successive heroines battering on the glass walls of convention that divide them from other worlds – human, animal or divine – where their desires are normal. Ovid works throughout to animate the question of who we think we are, and how we think about who we think we are. The",Metamorphoses: A New Verse Translation,Ovid,"uploaded,uploaded",449.0

"i) “partitioning failure” occurs when the correlation structure of the residual time series is indistinguishable from the Gaussian ensemble (note that depending on context, this could be replaced by other null models) and we cannot reliably find characteristic times series; and (ii) “projection failure” occurs when the characteristic time series are numerically linearly dependent. In the case of projection failure, the projection on V does not have a unique representation in terms of the characteristic time series. Our view is that in each iteration, the removal of the effect of the characteristic time series reveals residual structure that may have been masked by a dominant behavior.

"“partition decoupling method.” It is an iterative method in which spectral considerations (i.e., eigenvalues of a relevant matrix) are used to identify significant clusters via comparison to some relevant random model. The effect of these clusters is removed from the underlying data to reveal a residual layer of interaction ready for another round of structural decomposition. The iterated removal of the “cluster effect” is akin (in spirit) to the well-known “multiresolution analysis” that accompanies wavelet decompositions in signal and image processing (see e.g. refs. 6 and 7, and ref. 8, which contains a more general view of multiresolution analysis). It is likewise similar to a factor or principal component analysis (9) that creates a succession of approximations to a correlation matrix",Topological structures in the equities market network,"Gregory Leibon, Scott Pauls, Daniel Rockmore, Robert Savell, ude.htuomtrad.htam@eromkcor","uploaded,uploaded",0.0
